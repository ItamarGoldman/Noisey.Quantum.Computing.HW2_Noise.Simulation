Homework about noise in quantum computing and it's effect

In here we chose to look at the "Deutschâ€“Jozsa algorithm" and "Simon algorithm" and see the effect of diffrent noise models on them.
Here we use Thermal noise and T2* decoherence.


The code is using the library of qiskit that IBM provide to be used on their QC.
